# Fun-Python-Projects

This repository consists of small projects that help improve my Python programming skills and projects which I do just for fun.

## List of Projects:
1. **my_madlibs**: my version of the popular game 'Mad Libs' with a collection of different topics. It has sound effects to make the game more lively, and allows players to re-enter the words.
2. (to-be-updated)
