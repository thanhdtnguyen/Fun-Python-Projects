# Fun-Python-Projects

This repository consists of small projects that I do in free time to improve my Python programming skills and for fun.

## List of Projects:
1. **my_madlibs**: my version of the popular game 'Mad Libs' with a collection of different topics. It has sound effects to make the game more lively, and allows players to re-enter their inputs.
2. **active_computer**: a Python script that keeps computer active when not in use. 
3. (to-be-updated)
